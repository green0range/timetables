(A letter from the Prime Minister arrives!)

Tēnā koe hello!

Congratulations on your new job! As head of our new passenger rail service, you are now responsible for creating a major mode shift away from iNeFFiCiENT, gROsS and dIrTY I.C.E. vehicles!

I mean, just look at this blasted graph, our society is STUPIDLY car DEPENDENT. Oh, and dairy dependent, but that's not your problem... anyway, fix the cars. Meanwhile, Kiwirail is electrifying the track for you and Huntly's horrible coal monster is being deCOmMISSIONeD

So, Ah these are your objectives:
    1. You must have *% of towns with railway stations serviced before 2030
    2. You must have *% of towns with railway stations serviced before 2050
    3. You must be transporting *pkm/yr by 2030
    4. You must be transporting *pkm/yr by 2050
    
So a pkm is a `passenger-kilometre` it means you have transported 1 passenger 1 kilometre or 2 passengers 500 metres

To service a town, at least one train must STOP in the town to pickup and let off passengers.

Ngā mihi,
A Prime Minister who cares about climate (I wish I actually existed!)
