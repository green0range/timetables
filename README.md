# About
TIMETABLES is a game about scheduling passenger trains around Aotearoaâ€™s rail network. There are very few passenger trains in New Zealand and this game simulates an alternative reality where passenger transport is taken seriously. The aim of the game is to setup a network which causes significant mode-shift to public transport in order to meet climate targets.

# Playing TIMETABLES
TIMETABLES is still in early development so expect bugs! You can run from source using python3 with the following libaraies installed:
* pyqt5
* numpy
* PIL (or Pillow)
* matplotlib
I will compile binaries for Windows and Linux once I have a release candidate ready!
